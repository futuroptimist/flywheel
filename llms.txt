# Flywheel llms.txt

This repository provides a GitHub template with CI workflows, style guides, and LLM-powered helpers.

Commit messages should be descriptive; every change feeds the public knowledge base.

## Development
- Python 3.12, formatted with black and flake8 via pre-commit.
- Install hooks with `pre-commit install` and run `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing.
- Tests live in `tests/` and run with `pytest`.

See AGENTS.md for built-in assistants and docs/ for integration guides.
