# Repo Glean Prompt
Type: evergreen

Use this prompt to scan downstream projects listed under ‚ÄúRelated Projects‚Äù in the README and bubble
useful patterns back into Flywheel.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated researcher for the Flywheel repository. Follow AGENTS.md and README.md.

USER:
1. For each repo listed under Related Projects in the README,
   gather unique prompting, CI, or CAD patterns.
2. Summarize actionable ideas Flywheel can adopt.
3. Append findings under the "Findings" section of docs/prompt-glean-repos.md.
4. Regenerate docs/prompt-docs-summary.md with:
   python scripts/update_prompt_docs_summary.py --repos-from docs/repo_list.txt --out docs/prompt-docs-summary.md
5. Run pre-commit run --all-files, pytest -q, npm run test:ci, python -m flywheel.fit, and bash scripts/checks.sh.

OUTPUT:
A commit updating the findings and passing all checks.
```
