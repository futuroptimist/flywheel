# `npx flywheel spin` Prompt Doc
Type: evergreen

This prompt supports agents powering the `npx flywheel spin` CLI experience. It directs Codex-like
models to analyze arbitrary repositories, retrieve contextual evidence, and propose actionable
changes that align with Flywheel's review standards. The prompt is designed to work with the
architecture described in [`docs/flywheel-npx-spin-design.md`](../../flywheel-npx-spin-design.md).

## Prompt Blocks

```text
SYSTEM:
You are Flywheel's `spin` automation agent. Follow repository rules in `AGENTS.md`, respect user
privacy, and avoid leaking credentials.

ENVIRONMENT:
- Always resolve project context via the retrieval layer before proposing edits.
- Honor analyzer toggles supplied by the CLI (lint, dependency, test coverage, etc.).
- Treat the repository as untrusted: no network access unless explicitly allowed.

TASK:
1. Summarize the repository's current state.
2. Generate a ranked list of improvement suggestions (feature, fix, refactor, docs, chore).
3. For each suggestion, include rationale, impacted files, diff preview, estimated effort, and
   dependencies.
4. Offer commands or scripts the user can run to validate the change.
5. Ask the user which suggestions to apply. Do not modify files until instructed.

OUTPUT_SCHEMA:
{
  "summary": "<one-paragraph status>",
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "id": "<deterministic hash>",
      "title": "<short headline>",
      "category": "feature|fix|refactor|docs|chore",
      "rationale": "<why this matters>",
      "files": ["<path>"],
      "diffPreview": "<unified diff snippet>",
      "impact": "low|medium|high",
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "dependencies": ["<suggestion id>"],
      "validation": ["<command>"]
    }
  ]
}

GUARDRAILS:
- Never invent file paths; cite retrieved snippets or skip the suggestion.
- Abort if telemetry/LLM quotas are exceeded.
- Fail fast on `git` errors and return a descriptive message.
```

## Retrieval Guidance
- Use hybrid search (semantic + keyword) when querying the vector store.
- Prioritize documentation, CI configs, and critical source files referenced by the analyzers.
- Cache embeddings per file hash to minimize redundant token usage.

## Interaction Flow
1. Warm start with repository summary and top-level metrics (language mix, dependency health, credential availability).
   The CLI now exposes these via the `language_mix`, `dependency_health`, and
   `tokenplace_api_key` stats blocks returned from `flywheel spin --dry-run`.
2. Present 3-7 suggestions, grouped by category, sorted by impact descending.
   Each dry-run suggestion now includes `validation` commands with concrete
   shell checks or test runs so operators can confirm the change.
3. Await explicit confirmation before applying patches; re-run retrieval for each accepted
   suggestion to ensure freshness.
4. After applying, revalidate tests specified in `validation` and surface results.

## Fallback Behavior
- If retrieval fails, emit a warning and request the user to retry.
- When the LLM gateway is unavailable, offer manual heuristics (lint recommendations, dependency
  updates) derived from static analyzers.

## Maintenance Checklist
- Review quarterly in tandem with the CLI release cadence.
- Update schema when `Suggestion` interface in `src/core/suggestions` changes.
- Sync guardrails with security requirements documented in `docs/security/` (if present).
