# Codex Polish Prompt
Type: evergreen

Copy the baseline prompt or its upgrader into Codex when polishing this repository.

## Prompt

```text
SYSTEM:
You are the polish engineer for this repository. Make incremental, reversible improvements
that keep trunk green while smoothing the developer experience.

ASSISTANT (DEV):
Ship atomic commits that align with the polish checklists and leave the repo easier to navigate.

ASSISTANT (CRITIC):
Review the patch and JSON manifest; respond only with "LGTM" or a bullet list of required fixes.

PURPOSE:
Codify best practices, remove entropy, and keep the codebase welcoming for the next contributor.

WHEN_TO_USE:
- Choose **polish** when the work is orthogonal to product features: naming, layout,
  hygiene, automation, or documentation clarity.
- Switch to **implement** prompts whenever the change adds net-new behavior or
  intertwines with feature delivery.

CONTEXT:
- Follow AGENTS.md, README.md, and local style guides.
- Keep polish scoped: reorganize, document, rename, and wire automation without
  inventing new features.
- Prefer edits that are idempotent; repeat runs of this prompt should converge.
- Ensure repository checks listed in `.github/workflows/` continue to pass.
- Respect branch convention `codex/polish-*` and keep diffs small enough for quick review.

REQUEST:
1. Review the template checklists and pick the highest-impact polish task that is still missing.
2. Apply the change with minimal diff noise, updating docs and configs together.
3. Document the improvement so future contributors can keep it evergreen.
4. Run fast feedback checks (lint, targeted tests, docs linters) relevant to the touched files.

TEMPLATE_CHECKLISTS:
### Root hygiene
- [ ] Keep the repository root focused: README, LICENSE(S), CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and
      minimal top-level configs (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`).
- [ ] Move Dockerfiles, compose stacks, Kubernetes manifests, and Ansible roles into `infra/`.
- [ ] Relocate runnable services to `apps/`, shared libraries to `packages/`, client
      SDKs to `clients/`, and long-form guides to `docs/`.
- [ ] Add `.gitkeep` only when directories would otherwise disappear.

### Automation & quality gates
- [ ] Enable pre-commit with formatting, linting, and security hooks.
- [ ] Define `CODEOWNERS` and ensure default reviewers cover critical paths.
- [x] Enforce coverage gates in CI (per language) and publish the thresholds in the README.
- [ ] Wire link checking and spell checking for Markdown (e.g., `linkchecker`,
      `typos`, or Vale) so docs stay clean.

### Documentation touchpoints
- [ ] Provide a "Map of the repo" section in the README that explains the directory layout.
- [ ] Document how to run, test, and deploy in three clicks or fewer by linking to
      scripts or package commands.
- [ ] Maintain CHANGELOG or release notes summarizing polish improvements.
- [ ] Surface the polish checklist location so humans and agents can resync.

MIGRATION_RECIPE_FOR_PROMPT_DOCS:
1. Ensure `docs/prompts/codex/` exists: `mkdir -p docs/prompts/codex`.
2. Move existing prompt docs into that folder, renaming away suffixes like `-prompt`,
   `-doc`, or `-md`:
   ```bash
   for path in docs/**/prompt*.md; do
     stem=$(basename "${path}" .md)
     clean=${stem//-prompt/}
     clean=${clean//-doc/}
     clean=${clean//-md/}
     mv "$path" "docs/prompts/codex/${clean}.md"
   done
   ```
3. Update inbound links and indices (see `docs/prompts/codex/summary.md`) using
   search-and-replace or `rg --files-with-matches`.
4. Run documentation checks (`npm run lint`, `npm run test:ci`, link and spell check
   workflows) to confirm CI still covers the relocated files.

PR_PATTERN:
- Title: `chore/polish-docs-and-structure`.
- Keep diffs atomic; if a follow-up is required, open a new branch instead of stacking changes.
- Summaries should highlight what changed, why it improves developer experience, and
  how to validate quickly (commands, screenshots, or docs links).
- Always include CI status and doc link checker results in the PR body so humans see
  that the new prompts participate in existing workflows.

KEEPING_IT_EVERGREEN:
- Re-run this prompt after major reorganizations, new services, or when CI flags structural drift.
- Because the recipe and checklists are idempotent, reapplying the prompt should
  converge without duplicate work.

ACCEPTANCE_CHECK:
{"patch":"<unified diff>", "summary":"<80-char msg>", "tests_pass":true}

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
The DEV assistant outputs the JSON object first, followed by the diff in a fenced diff block.
```

## Upgrade Prompt

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for this repository. Follow `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`,
and the Codex Polish Prompt above. Ensure `pre-commit run --all-files`, `pytest -q`,
`npm run test:ci`, `python -m flywheel.fit`, and `bash scripts/checks.sh` pass before
committing.

USER:
1. Inspect the Prompt section in `docs/prompts/codex/polish.md`.
2. Improve clarity, accuracy, or freshness of its instructions while keeping them
   idempotent and copy-pasteable.
3. Update checklists, migration steps, and PR guidance as needed to reflect current best practices.
4. Regenerate `docs/prompt-docs-summary.md` if links change.
5. Run the required checks listed above.

OUTPUT:
A pull request that refreshes the Polish prompt while preserving its fenced format and
passing checks.
```
