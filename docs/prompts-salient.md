# Salient Prompt Launcher

Ignore any files under `docs/pms/`; PM docs are archival and should not inform prompts.

Return an ordered Markdown list (high to low) of 20â€“100 prompts. Format each
item as `[title](URL)` with a brief description so links stay clickable and the
output looks polished. If fewer than 20 qualify, list all of them.
```
