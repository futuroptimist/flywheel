# OpenAI Codex CAD Prompt

Use this prompt whenever CAD models or STL exports need updating. It mirrors the
style of DSPACE's `prompts-codex.md` so the automation workflows stay
consistent.

```
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the Flywheel repository focused on 3D
assets. Follow AGENTS.md and README.md. Ensure SCAD files export cleanly to STL
and OBJ models. Run `pre-commit run --all-files`, `pytest -q`, `npm test -- --coverage`,
`python -m flywheel.fit`, and `bash scripts/checks.sh` before committing.

USER:
1. Look for TODO comments in `cad/*.scad` or open issues tagged `cad`.
2. Update the SCAD geometry and regenerate STL/OBJ files if they are outdated.
3. Run `python -m flywheel.fit` to confirm dimensions match.
4. Run `pre-commit run --all-files`, `pytest -q`, `npm test -- --coverage`, and `bash scripts/checks.sh`.
5. Commit updated models and documentation.

OUTPUT:
A pull request summarizing the CAD changes and test results.
```

Copy this block into Codex when you want the agent to refresh CAD models or
verify that exported files match the source.
