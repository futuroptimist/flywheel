# Integrating with Gabriel

[Gabriel](https://github.com/futuroptimist/gabriel) is an open source "guardian angel" LLM that helps you secure your digital life. The project adopts the same flywheel methodology for rapid improvement, documented in Gabriel's `docs/FLYWHEEL_RISK_MODEL.md`.

Pairing Gabriel with flywheel provides a built-in security advisor as your repositories evolve. Both projects are expected to grow together, sharing lessons and tooling.

## Why Gabriel Matters

Gabriel's `FLYWHEEL_RISK_MODEL.md` explores how the rapid automation loops promoted by flywheel can introduce new security concerns. Integrating Gabriel early lets you:

- audit dependencies or code generated by flywheel agents
- maintain an evolving threat model as the repository grows
- share best practices and scripts between the two projects

Expect improvements in security tooling or agent workflows to flow both ways as these repositories mature.

## Quick start

1. Clone Gabriel next to this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/futuroptimist/gabriel
   ```
2. Review Gabriel's risk model:
   ```bash
   cat gabriel/docs/FLYWHEEL_RISK_MODEL.md
   ```
3. Use Gabriel's future CLI commands to audit your flywheel-managed projects.
