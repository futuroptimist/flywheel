# Integrating with Gabriel

[Gabriel](https://github.com/futuroptimist/gabriel) is an open source "guardian angel" LLM that helps you secure your digital life. The project adopts the same flywheel methodology for rapid improvement, documented in Gabriel's `docs/FLYWHEEL_RISK_MODEL.md`.

Pairing Gabriel with flywheel provides a built-in security advisor as your repositories evolve. Both projects are expected to grow together, sharing lessons and tooling.

## Quick start

1. Clone Gabriel next to this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/futuroptimist/gabriel
   ```
2. Review Gabriel's risk model:
   ```bash
   cat gabriel/docs/FLYWHEEL_RISK_MODEL.md
   ```
3. Use Gabriel's future CLI commands to audit your flywheel-managed projects.
