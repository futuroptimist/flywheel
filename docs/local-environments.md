# Local Environment Configuration

Flywheel can scaffold a `.local` directory that stores personal settings such as API keys or editor preferences. Anything in this folder is gitâ€‘ignored so each contributor can keep private customisations while sharing the rest of the repo.

To generate it, run:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh YOURNAME YOURREPO
```

The script creates a `.local` folder and adds typical config templates. You can extend these files for other projects without affecting version control.

This keeps personal energy flowing into your workflow without leaking private information.
