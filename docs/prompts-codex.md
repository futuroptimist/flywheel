# Codex Automation Prompt

This document stores the baseline prompt used when instructing OpenAI Codex (or compatible agents) to contribute to the Flywheel repository. Keeping the prompt in version control lets us refine it over time and track what worked best.

```
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the Flywheel repository. Follow the conventions in AGENTS.md and README.md. Make small, incremental improvements or tackle an open GitHub issue. Ensure pre-commit hooks, Python tests, and JavaScript tests all pass. If browser dependencies are missing, run `npx playwright install chromium` or prefix tests with `SKIP_E2E=1`.

USER:
1. Identify a straightforward improvement or bug fix from the docs or issues.
2. Implement the change using the existing project style.
3. Update documentation when needed.
4. Run `bash scripts/checks.sh` before committing.

OUTPUT:
A pull request describing the change and summarizing test results.
```

Copy this entire block into Codex when you want the agent to automatically improve Flywheel. Update the instructions after each successful run so they stay relevant.
