# Quest Generator

Flywheel previously tracked a quest generator CLI for DSPACE, but that
automation now lives in the dedicated `democratizedspace/dspace` repository.
This guide remains as a pointer so contributors know where to look when they
need to scaffold new quests.

Visit the DSPACE repository for up-to-date instructions and scripts that create
quest templates. Flywheel will focus on generalized quest tooling rather than
shipping game-specific generators here.
