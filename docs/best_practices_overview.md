This documentation outlines recommended workflows, CI setup, and guidelines to keep your project healthy.

## Energy Across Dimensions

- **Code conventions** ensure consistent style. See the style guides in `docs/styleguides`.
- **Local environments** keep personal tweaks in `.local` as described in `docs/local-environments.md`.
- **Use uv** for Python dependency management to dramatically speed up installs.
- **Positive-sum values** guide our decisions. We favor regenerative, empathetic, and open-source approaches.
