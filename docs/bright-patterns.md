# Bright Patterns

This catalog lists design choices that respect user autonomy and well-being. They are the positive counterparts to the dark patterns described in [dark-patterns.md](dark-patterns.md).

| Bright pattern | Why it's helpful |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Transparent labeling | Users know exactly what each action will do and can make informed decisions. |
| Easy opt-out | Subscriptions and data collection can be declined or cancelled in a single step. |
| Upfront pricing | All fees are disclosed early so there are no payment surprises. |
| Respectful privacy choices | Users can opt out of tracking or share only the data they want. |
| Simple account deletion | Leaving a service is as easy as joining. |
| Neutral language | Decline options avoid guilt-tripping or coercive wording. |
| Clearly labeled ads | Promotional content is unmistakable so it doesn't mislead. |
| Straightforward navigation | Buttons and links do exactly what they say. |
| Dismissible reminders | Notifications can be permanently turned off. |
| Plain language questions | No trick phrasing or double negatives. |
| Explicit order confirmation | Nothing is added to a cart or order without clear consent. |

Use these bright patterns to build trust and foster positive engagement.
