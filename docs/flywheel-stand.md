# Flywheel Stand and Shaft

This guide covers a simple stand and matching shaft for the flywheel. The design uses ubiquitous 608 skateboard bearings so parts are easy to source.

## Materials

- **608 bearings** – 22\,mm outer diameter, 8\,mm inner diameter, 7\,mm thick.
- **PLA or PETG** – for printing the stand.
- **Metal rod** – 8\,mm diameter if you prefer a metal shaft.

The CAD files `hardware/cad/stand.scad` and `hardware/cad/shaft.scad` can be tweaked to change these dimensions.

## Printing

1. Adjust the parameters in each SCAD file if needed.
2. Export to STL and slice with your preferred software.

## Assembly

1. Press one bearing into each side of the stand.
2. Slide the shaft through the bearings.
3. Attach the flywheel securely to the shaft using screws or adhesive.

This setup lets the shaft spin smoothly on common skateboard bearings.
