# Missing Postmortem Guidance

- **Date**: 2025-08-09
- **Author**: Codex
- **Status**: resolved

## What went wrong
The CI fix prompt lacked guidance to create postmortems after failures.

## Root cause
No instruction directed contributors to document background, impact, and follow-up steps.

## Impact
Teams missed context from past failures, slowing diagnosis of future CI issues.

## Actions to take
- Document future CI fixes with a mini postmortem and track follow-up items.
