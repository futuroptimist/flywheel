# Flywheel Physics

A spinning flywheel stores energy as rotational inertia.
This short explainer shows how to estimate that energy
and how GitHub renders formulas using LaTeX.

## Moment of inertia

For a solid cylinder,
$$I = \tfrac{1}{2} m r^2$$
where $m$ is mass and $r$ is radius.
Larger and heavier wheels have more inertia.

## Stored energy

The kinetic energy of a rotating wheel is
$$E = \tfrac{1}{2} I \omega^2$$
with angular velocity $\omega$ in radians per second.

GitHub automatically displays these formulas when
LaTeX expressions are wrapped in dollar signs.
