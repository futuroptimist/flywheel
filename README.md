**flywheel** is a GitHub template for rapid project bootstrapping. It bundles linting, testing, documentation checks, and LLM-powered agents to keep your repo healthy.

## Usage

1. **Use as a template** on GitHub.
2. Clone your new repo and run `./scripts/setup.sh YOURNAME NEWREPO` to personalize placeholders.
3. Commit and push to start the flywheel.

## Contents

- CI workflows for linting, tests, and docs
- DEPENDABOT for automated dependency updates
- CodeQL workflow for security scanning
- Style guides for Python and JavaScript
- Example code and templates
- Python CLI with subcommands `init`, `update`, `audit`, and `prompt` that prompts interactively unless `--yes` is used
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) detailing included LLM assistants
- Axel integration guide in `docs/axel-integration.md`
- token.place roadmap in `docs/tokenplace-roadmap.md`
- local environment guide in `docs/local-environments.md`
- token.place features in `docs/tokenplace-features.md`
- token.place PRD in `docs/tokenplace-PRD.md`

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/NEWREPO.git
cd NEWREPO

# Personalize badge URLs and docs
./scripts/setup.sh YOURNAME NEWREPO

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initialize flywheel"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run checks before committing
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Embedding in an existing project

Install the CLI and inject dev tooling. Without `--yes`, the command prompts for language and whether to add dev tools:

```bash
pipx run flywheel init . --language python --save-dev --yes
```

### Generating Codex prompts

Invoke the prompt agent to get repo-aware suggestions:

```bash
flywheel prompt
```

## Values

We aim for a positive-sum, empathetic community. The flywheel embraces regenerative and open-source principles to keep energy cycling back into every project.
