**flywheel** is a GitHub template for rapid project bootstrapping. It bundles linting, testing, documentation checks, and LLM-powered agents to keep your repo healthy.

## Usage

1. **Use as a template** on GitHub.
2. Clone your new repo and run `./scripts/setup.sh YOURNAME NEWREPO` to personalize placeholders.
3. Commit and push to start the flywheel.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/NEWREPO.git
cd NEWREPO

# Personalize badge URLs and docs
./scripts/setup.sh YOURNAME NEWREPO

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initialize flywheel"

# Install uv and pre-commit hooks
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run checks before committing
bash scripts/checks.sh
```

The script includes a spell checker powered by `codespell`. Add project-specific
terms to `dict/allow.txt` so they are not flagged as typos. VS Code users will
see the same suggestions if they install the recommended Code Spell Checker
extension. A GitHub Action runs the `typos` checker on every push to catch
misspellings that slip past local hooks.

### Embedding in an existing project

Install the CLI and inject dev tooling. Without `--yes`, the command prompts for language and whether to add dev tools:

```bash
pipx run flywheel init . --language python --save-dev --yes
```

### Generating Codex prompts

Invoke the prompt agent to get repo-aware suggestions:

```bash
flywheel prompt
```

### Generating repo feature summary

Create a Markdown table showing which flywheel files each repo uses:

```bash
flywheel crawl --repos-file docs/repo_list.txt --output docs/repo-feature-summary.md
```

Append `@branch` to any repo to crawl a non-default branch, e.g. `owner/name@dev`. Lines in `docs/repo_list.txt` are combined with any repos passed on the command line.
Pass `--token YOURTOKEN` or set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid API rate limits.
The `Update Repo Feature Summary` workflow commits `docs/repo-feature-summary.md` to `main` after each merge.
The summary records the short SHA of the latest commit, the name of each repository's default branch, and whether the latest commit passed CI on that branch.

### Auditing dev tooling

Verify that a repository contains the expected CI workflows and config files:

```bash
flywheel audit path/to/repo
```

### Scanning other repositories

Clone a set of repos and generate Markdown reports:

```bash
python -m flywheel.agents.scanner
```

Reports are written to `reports/`.

### Viewing the 3D flywheel

Run the bundled Flask app to explore the CAD models:

```bash
python webapp/app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:42165` and watch the wheel spin in your browser.

Alternatively, open `viewer/threejs.html` for a standalone Three.js demo that loads the STL parts and shows simple ball bearings.

### Verifying CAD fit

Install the Python requirements if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the fit checker to ensure the exported STLs match the SCAD sources:

```bash
python -m flywheel.fit
```

A successful run prints:

```
All parts fit together.
```

Below is a simplified view of how the pieces stack:

  Stand --> Shaft
  Shaft --> Adapter
  Adapter --> Flywheel
```

## Values

We aim for a positive-sum, empathetic community. The flywheel embraces regenerative and open-source principles to keep energy cycling back into every project.
