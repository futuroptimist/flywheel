# Sunlu Spool Core Sleeves

These OpenSCAD presets adapt Sunlu-branded filament spools to the Bambu Lab AMS.
They wrap the 55 mm AMS hub and expand to the measured spool diameter.

## Naming convention

`sunlu55_to<OD>[cyl]_len<length>.scad`

- `55` – inner bore diameter (AMS hub)
- `<OD>` – starting outer diameter of the sleeve
- `cyl` – optional straight cylinder used to push out a tapered sleeve
- `len<length>` – axial length of the part in millimeters
